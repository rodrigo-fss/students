# Challenge 2 - Spark Analysis

You can check some analysis made as example in the `page_view_analysis.ipynb` jupyter notebook.

Any metric or dataframe shown there could be inserted directly into a database - for some near real time analysis - or persisted as a parquet or json into some storage like S3 or GCS, following the pipeline describe in challenge 1!
